# 📘 Great Kingdom RL — Reinforcement Learning Agent for a Custom Strategy Game

This repository contains **Great Kingdom**, a custom 9×9 strategic board game, along with a **Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent** trained using **PPO + a custom CNN** in parallel environments.

It includes:

- A full Pygame-based board game implementation  
- A Gymnasium-compatible environment  
- A custom CNN feature extractor for board states  
- A parallel PPO training pipeline using Stable-Baselines3  
- An interactive UI for playing against the trained AI

## 🏰 Game Overview

Great Kingdom is a deterministic, turn-based strategy game played on a **9×9 grid**.

Two players, **Blue (1)** and **Red (2)**, take turns placing stones on the board:

- The board starts with a **neutral tile** in the center (value `3`).
- Placement rules and captures are based on **liberties** (similar to the game of Go).
- The game tracks:
  - Legal/illegal moves  
  - Captures  
  - Territory  
  - Game-over conditions  
  - Final scoring with **komi** (default: 3.0 for Red)

The game ends when:

- A capture immediately determines the winner, or  
- No legal moves remain, or  
- The board is full and final territory scoring is applied.

The final winner is decided by comparing **Blue territory** vs **Red territory + komi**.

## Current RL pipeline

- MaskablePPO with occupied/territory action masking
- Canonical observations for both Red and Blue player perspectives
- Alternating continuation training against one explicitly frozen policy
- One generation per explicit `run_alternating_generation.py` invocation

See [PROJECT_STATE_20260822.md](PROJECT_STATE_20260822.md) for the validated
state and next GPU step. Checkpoint paths, hashes, and counters are recorded in
[CHECKPOINT_MANIFEST.md](CHECKPOINT_MANIFEST.md). Model ZIP files are local
